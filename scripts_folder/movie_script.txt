THE SHOP

INT. COFFEE SHOP - DAY

The bustling coffee shop is filled with people typing away on laptops.

EMMA, a young woman in her twenties, sips her coffee while reading a book.

                        JACK (O.S.)
            Mind if I join you?

EMMA looks up to see JACK, a charming man with a friendly smile.

                        EMMA
            Sure, go ahead.

JACK sits down across from her.

                        JACK
            What are you reading?

                        EMMA
            It's a mystery novel. Keeps me on the edge.

They share a smile.

CUT TO:

EXT. CITY STREET - EVENING

The sun sets as people hurry home.

EMMA walks down the street, lost in thought.

A car pulls up beside her.

                        JACK
            Need a ride?

EMMA hesitates for a moment, then smiles.

                        EMMA
            Why not?

She gets into the car.

FADE OUT.
